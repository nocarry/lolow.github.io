## Abstract
This paper deals with an oracle method to couple economic and climate models. The approach permits a dialogue between two models pertaining to two different scientific domains, the climate module being a fully-coupled ocean-atmosphere-sea ice model, whereas the economic module is an adaptation of the neo-classical optimal economic growth paradigm. The paper explains how the Analytic Center Cutting Plane Method (ACCPM) is implemented to integrate in the optimal economic growth model a constraint on climate change that is computed from the climate model runs. Several experiments show the usefulness of the approach to build new types of integrated assessment meta-models.
