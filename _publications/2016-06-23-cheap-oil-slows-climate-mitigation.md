## Abstract
The oil industry has a history of booms and busts, and prices have slumped significantly over the past two years. The drop in prices will have a rapid effect on the energy sector and global economy. Low oil prices result in less investment in the exploration for (and extraction of ) oil and gas, and could simultaneously see increased demand for related equipment and services, stimulating the worldâ€™s economy. If cheap oil becomes the new normal, there may be no price constraint to prevent burning of the remaining underground oil and gas resources. In such a world, carbon emissions could continue to grow, and temperatures may rise to significant levels if no action is taken.
